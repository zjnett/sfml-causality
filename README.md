A platformer-RPG with consequence.

Causality is a platformer/role-playing game hybrid developed primarily using SFML and C++.

## Background
Causality was originally developed as a Unity project as a 3D game developed using C# and Yarn dialogue scripting tools. However, with a lack of previous experience with 3D game development and particularly with 3D modeling, progress quickly halted.

SFML was chosen because of its barebones structure and computer platform (operating system) availablity, as well as due to slightly more formal experience with C++ development.

## Design
The original Causality project did not employ platformer elements due to its 3D design- however, when faced with the design constraints and opportunities of a 2D platform (no pun intended), the decision to employ basic platformer elements seemed obvious.
